<h2 id="chikcen-satay-skewerssate-ayam"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satay">Chikcen Satay Skewers/Sate Ayam</a></h2>
<p>Sate ayam is a popular Indonesian dish consisting of skewered and grilled chicken. The chicken meat is marinated in a flavorful blend of herbs, spices, and sometimes soy sauce or coconut milk, to infuse it with a delicious taste. The skewers are then grilled over hot charcoal, resulting in tender and juicy chicken with a hint of smoky flavor. Sate ayam is often served with a side of peanut sauce, which adds a rich and nutty element to the dish. It is a beloved street food in Indonesia, enjoyed as a snack or a main course, and is best enjoyed when eaten together with steamed rice or wrapped in a warm piece of lontong (compressed rice cake).</p>
